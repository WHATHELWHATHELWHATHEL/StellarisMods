# javascript for Generate galaxy

### Galaxy Generate
The generate.js in the folder is used to generate a basically random galaxy with
some systems in fixed position and given initializers.
Since the paradox limit the galaxy generation can only be achieved in two type:

* complete random generation
* complete static generation with every galaxy generated in fixed position

To generate a random systems with some fixed system, I have created the .js script
to do this job. Requirements as follow

1. The script should run in a node.js environment
2. The generate.js is the main script that undertake the generation. DON'T if you are not 100% clear about its implementation.
3. Edit the param.js to adjust the number of the systems in the galaxy and special systems with prescripted position and initializers.
